I have prepared a working backbone of the exporter.And with this I have exported the lamp setting with custom UI in Blender.
The directory structure is shown below. With the progress of time new files will be added to this structure and incomplete files will be completed.

.:
io => directory containing codes related to yafaray  
layout_code_2.py => UI code helper  
README 
ui => directory containing codes related to blender python API from drawing GUI

./io:
yafaray => directory

./io/yafaray:

__init__.py 
yaf_light.py    => light settings codes (completed)
yaf_properties.py =>   (incomplete)
yaf_export.py   => main exporter/render that will call all others  
yaf_object.py   => mesh setting codes (incomplete)
yaf_config.py  => (configuration)


./ui:
yaf_light.py   => UI code for drawing light settings of yafaray(complete)


Schedule for the next week:

In the next week I want to complete the codes related to mesh settings and also try to export
yafaray camera settings with UI components.

How to test and run the code:

copy the yafaray folder in .blender/scripts/io folder.
copy contents of ui folder into .blender/scripts/ui folder.
edit yaf_config.py according to your pc settings.
run blender.
select "yafRay Render" from available renderers.
you can change the light setting from the new UI.
click render to render image.
Thats all.
