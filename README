Yafaray exporter for Blender 2.55

The exporter is in a very experimental stage so use it for testing purposes only

For the latest builds check http://www.yafaray.org/development and graphicall.org

Downloading and extract at Blender/2.55/scripts/addons/yafaray directory
This will create a dir /bin/plugins containing the necessary files.

We need to test it and report errors found.
Thanks.
